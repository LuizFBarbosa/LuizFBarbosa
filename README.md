My name is Luiz Fernando Barbosa from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Mobile Developer since 1996 and currently I'm Senior Developer at [Arcom SA](https://arcom.com.br). I'm passionate about game projects, so I've created some projects as https://www.provadeconceito.wordpress.com) and I like to imagine how certain applications and technologies were made, so I like to do some proof of concept..

In my free time I like to study machine learning, to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) I like to cook and make breads (🍞) and cakes (🍰).

I like to do volunteer work.

Would you like to find me?
